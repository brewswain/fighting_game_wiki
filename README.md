# Fighting Game Wiki/Repository

## Web app served using Firebase

---

This project was created with the goal of making a fighting game wiki that is both familiar to current users of other such wikis, and impressively updated with UX in mind.

This project was purposefully created utilizing older practises for site creation, i.e. Server Sided Rendering was not used, nor were any front-end frameworks employed. Multiple html files are loaded based on links used for each individual character. Table elements were manually used instead of using divs aligned with CSS Grid. This led me to appreciate how current development practises can make development speed faster as, even though this site is simple in design, it took me the longest to complete based on continuous time spent coding just due to sheer data entry and the need to use individual files.

That being said, the actual design was based on what I envisioned modern fighting game wikis can improve on with UX in mind. For instance, please note the navbars on the side are fixed in position, ensuring that you wouldn't need to scroll up to the top of the page to navigate to different sections (Something that's shockingly a common experience up to today in the majority of wiki sites.) I also added ways to connect with top players, provided user resources, day 1 combos to learn as a character roadmap, and footage of each character played at a high level.
